# Active Recon :

  i) DNS Recon : 
      a) Zonetransfer : Transferring the all dns information to the secondary dns server which is controlled by an adversary (Attacker) 
        cmd : dig axfr logicmo.com

  ii) Subdomain Enumeration : 
      a) fierce : fierce -d logicmo.com
      b) knockpy : knockpy locicmo.com



2) PORT SCANS : 
          nmap


3) Vulnerability scans:
                      nikto -h logicmo.com


# Automated Recon Frameworks : 

sn1per : 
        sniper -t logicmo.com  -> # this will perform an active recon on the target 

        sniper -t logicmo -m stealth -o -re -> # This will perform an passive Recon on the target
